A Python project for interacting with the Arterys medical imaging AI platform via its API. 
[Arterys](https://www.arterys.com/) aims to transform how radiological data is analyzed and shared, offering cloud-based, AI-enabled platforms that allow healthcare providers to gain deeper and faster insights from radiology images. By leveraging powerful algorithms and cloud technology, Arterys is breaking down traditional barriers in healthcare delivery and diagnosis.

The company's main innovation lies in its ability to deliver real-time, automated image interpretation across multiple imaging modalities, including [Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/mri), [Computed Tomography (CT)](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/ctscan), [X-ray](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/xray), and even [Ultrasound](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/ultrasound). Instead of relying solely on human interpretation, physicians can now access AI-generated measurements, diagnostic suggestions, and structured reports, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing reporting times.

</p>

Using Arterys begins with securely uploading medical images to its cloud platform via an encrypted interface. The platform processes these images through deep learning algorithms specifically trained for tasks such as lesion detection, organ segmentation, anomaly spotting, and disease progression tracking. Once the analysis is complete, the results are presented in an intuitive dashboard where physicians can validate findings, make adjustments, and finalize reports ready for integration into hospital information systems like [Electronic Health Records (EHRs)](https://www.himss.org/resources/what-electronic-health-record-ehr).

A key application of Arterys technology is in [cardiology](https://www.acc.org/). The Cardio AI solution enables fast, reproducible measurements of blood flow, heart function, and cardiac volumes from MRI scans, replacing labor-intensive manual workflows. For lung imaging, Arterys Lung AI helps detect and monitor pulmonary nodules, which are critical for early-stage lung cancer detection. Meanwhile, Oncology AI provides clinicians with tools to assess tumor progression, response to therapy, and automate RECIST 1.1 measurements in oncology imaging.

Who uses Arterys? Primarily, [radiologists](https://www.rsna.org/), [cardiologists](https://www.acc.org/), [oncologists](https://www.asco.org/), and [neurologists](https://www.neurology.org/) across hospitals, outpatient imaging centers, and academic research institutions. Leading medical institutions and private practices alike are adopting Arterys to improve efficiency and diagnostic performance. The platform also supports remote collaboration, enabling doctors across different locations to work together seamlessly on complex cases.

A major advantage of Arterys is its cloud-native architecture, which eliminates the need for heavy, expensive on-site servers. This approach not only reduces IT overhead costs but also allows facilities of any size — from major hospitals to small clinics — to access cutting-edge AI capabilities. The system adheres to strict data privacy regulations, including [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) in the United States and [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) in Europe, ensuring that sensitive patient data is handled responsibly.

Arterys also encourages continual learning and improvement of its AI models by partnering with leading research institutions and clinical teams. Its open platform allows healthcare providers to incorporate new algorithms, tailor workflows, and drive innovation in medical imaging practices.

Looking ahead, Arterys is expanding into areas like [population health management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466591/) and predictive analytics, aiming to help healthcare systems identify at-risk patients earlier, optimize treatments, and improve outcomes at scale. As healthcare increasingly moves towards personalized, data-driven care, platforms like Arterys are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of diagnostics and treatment planning worldwide.

In short, Arterys is not just enhancing the speed and accuracy of medical imaging — it is redefining what is possible when artificial intelligence meets clinical expertise. By providing real-time, AI-powered insights at the point of care, Arterys is empowering doctors to make faster, smarter decisions that ultimately benefit patients around the globe.
